# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction

### Quick overview:
This project is done fully in R. Its goal is to fit a model to most accurately classify patients as having a **high or low risk of heart disease** based on variables like **cholesterol levels**, **sex**, **age**, **resting blood pressure**, etc.

### About the data:
The data is from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?select=heart.csv).

The variables are:
- Age: age of the patient [years]
- Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
- MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
- ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
- HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
